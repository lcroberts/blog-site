My name is Logan Roberts. I am a computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). I have experience programming in java, python, and scripting in bash. As of July 19, 2023 I have the "AWS Certified Developer - Associate" certification.

Most of my java experience comes from school where most of our classes require we code in java. When I used Windows as my primary OS I tended to use python for my scripting needs, but now that I'm on linux I find bash to be much more convenient to use.
