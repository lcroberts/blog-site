I'll start this off by saying that this is a blog post written out of frustration and anger. Anytime I have to watch classmates and instructors who edit code at a snails pace, a little bit of me dies. I'm not talking situations where they are going slow because they are thinking as they type. I am talking about when someone knows exactly what they are putting down, but they are bottlenecked by the speed at which code is coming from their hands. I am of the opinion that your brain should be your bottleneck, not your hands.

# The value of keeping your brain as your bottleneck

# Common bottlenecks

I have observed a few common things that are commonly the bottleneck. The first (and I think the most obvious) is slow typing speed. While you don't need to be super fast at typing, it is certainly an easy way to increase the speed at which you code. I don't really even consider myself very fast at typing but many people seem to have put little to no thought to the idea that typing fast might help them.
