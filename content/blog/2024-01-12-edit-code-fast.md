I'll start this off by saying that this is a blog post written out of frustration and anger. Anytime I have to watch classmates and instructors who edit code at a snails pace, a little bit of me dies. I'm not talking situations where they are going slow because they are thinking as they type. I am talking about when someone knows exactly what they are putting down, but they are bottlenecked by the speed at which code is coming from their hands. I am of the opinion that your brain should be your bottleneck, not your hands.

# Keep Your Brain As Your Bottleneck

# Learn To Type Fast

# Pick The Right Tool

# Use Keybindings

# There's (Almost) Always A Better Way To Do Things
