This is a post written out of frustration more than anything else. At my college I've watched a fair amount of people code and often they go way slower than I think they should be able to. It's generally not that they don't know what they are trying to do, most people have at least a general idea of what they want to do, it just takes them a while to turn that idea into runnable code. I've seen this pattern with both instructors and students and it frustrates me. I strongly believe that your brain should be your bottleneck while coding, not your hands.

# Learn To Type Fast

# Pick The Right Tool

# Use Keybindings
