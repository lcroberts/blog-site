This is a post written out of frustration more than anything else. At my college I've watched a fair amount of people code and often they go way slower than I think they should be able to. It's generally not that they don't know what they are trying to do, most people have at least a general idea of what they want to do, it just takes them a while to turn that idea into runnable code. I've seen this pattern with both instructors and students and it frustrates me. I strongly believe that your brain should be your bottleneck while coding, not your hands.

# Keep Your Brain As Your Bottleneck

Software development is problem solving, and our most useful tool in problem solving is our brain. When working on a problem we don't want our brain to be ahead of what we are able to put down into code. This can lead to what I'll call "lost thoughts." Lost thoughts are thoughts that you don't have time to do anything with before they leave your mind. We've all had them before. It's that feeling when you get up and walk into another room only to forget what you went there to do. To minimize the number of our thoughts that become lost thoughts in software development we want to speed up the rate at which we can write code. If you can get quick enough the bottleneck of code away from your hands and into your brain. This lets us get more use out of our most valuable tool, our brain.

# Learn To Type Fast

The most obvious way to get faster at writing code is to type faster. This even seems like one of those things that shouldn't even need to be said. However, based on my experience watching other student code, it should be said. Many people I've met seem to not think about how fast they're typing. As software developers it is something we should think about. Faster typing leads to more code we can write in the same amount of time. It's not even very difficult to increase typing speed, though it may take some time. All you have to do is actively practice. A little bit every day helps a lot.

There are two main ways I personally practice typing. The first and most readily available way is [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/). It is open source and the github repo can be found [here.](https://github.com/Instagram/MonkeyType) It's a great way to practice typing plain English words. There are a few tips I have to get the most of it. Actively push your typing speed, don't just passively type. Without pushing yourself you won't notice any speedups. Also, try to type words instead of letters. By this I mean try to get to the point where you don't think about the letters you are typing and instead are just focusing on the words.

Another good way to practice typing speed is by writing notes. While in class I tend to take notes as both a way to stay focused and to practice typing. The fact that I can search through them later is always a nice bonus as well. Using this method I try to type out as much as possible, but it can't be at the detriment of listening to the instructor or understanding what is going on. In this way it's much more similar to what you do when you write code that using monkeytype. Your brain needs to primarily be focused elsewhere and typing should be almost on autopilot. It's a great exercise to get better at this.

# Use The Right Tool

Another seemingly obvious way to get faster at software development is to make sure you're using good tools for what you're trying to do. This can be a text editor/IDE or it can another CLI/GUI app you are using to do sample API calls. Many times the "right" tool is also subject to personal preference, though sometimes certain tools are just better.

The most obvious form of this is your IDE choice. There's a wide selection of editors and IDEs each of which has a certain approach. The approach of VS Code is much different that that of a Jetbrains IDE. Many times the right editor depends on the language or what you are writing. I personally generally prefer to use neovim as I like the vim style keybindings and extensibility. However, when I'm writing Java I don't use neovim. I instead switch to using Intellij as it handles the distributed nature of Java projects much better than neovim did. Part of making sure you are using the right tool, is trying several for the same use-case. Given enough experience with tools, you'll find generic things you like or dislike which can be used to more quickly determine if something is a good fit in the future.

Another great example of using the right tool can be found with the tool [jq.](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) It's a command line JSON processor and is great when you need to quickly deal with a small amount of JSON data. It's much better than writing a small program you're only going to use once for one specific piece of JSON as a part of development. It's much faster than that as well.

Try not to get too focused on the examples I've provided here. I want the following idea to be the focus:

The right tool will make your life easier, your workflow better, and your development faster. Also, the tool you are familiar with is not always the best one for the job. Sometimes you need to try other things before you see what's problematic with what you are currently using.

# Use Keybindings

# There's (Almost) Always A Better Way To Do Things

## Sometimes There's An Initial Slowdown

## Learn From Other Developers
