My name is Logan Roberts. I am a computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). I have experience programming in java, python, and scripting in bash. As of July 19, 2023 I have the "AWS Certified Developer - Associate" certification.

Most of my java experience comes from school where most of our classes require we code in java. When I used Windows as my primary OS I tended to use python for my scripting needs, but now that I'm on Linux I find bash to be much more convenient to use.

I enjoy tinkering with both computer hardware and software. I built my own PC and have upgraded in several times. I tend to stay up to date with new hardware releases, particularly for consumer desktops, though I do have some interest in server and workstation platforms as well. On my PC I'm currently running the sway spin of Fedora workstation. Once I got a second nvme drive I opted to dual boot Windows and Linux, though most of my time these days is spent in Linux. The only time I boot into Windows is when I want to play games that don't work particularly well under Linux such as VR games or some games with anti cheat such as Destiny 2. Luckily most games I want to play use Linux compatible anti cheat so booting into Windows is rare these days.

I initially installed Linux just to experiment with it, and I wanted to do it bare metal, after playing around with it in VMs for a while. After the launch of Windows 11, I felt that the experience on Windows was getting worse and wanted to look at other options. As someone who's fairly security and privacy focused, I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to try an OS without telemetry as well. While those were the initial motivators for trying out Linux I've stayed on it since for the control I feel I have over my system. I love having the ability customize and tweak things to my liking. Whether it be trying out different desktop environments or window manager, or things like the ability to create systemd services to automatically keep my flatpak apps up to date there's so many things you can do under Linux that you can't under Windows. Now playing around with things on my system is one of my hobbies.
